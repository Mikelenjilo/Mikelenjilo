# Mouhoub-Massinissa

Welcome to My README!

Hello guys, I am Massinissa Mouhoub (Massi for short), I live in Algeria, and Im a Computer Science (Computer Networking to be more precise) student in USTHB in Algiers.
I always want to learn more, gain knowledge and to be a better version of myself. I wanna achieve my goals and help others achieve theirs aswell.

I'm interested in Mobile app developement, mainly using Flutter, but I will expand my knowledge into native technologies (Kotlin, Swift etc). I'm currently focusing on creating my portfolio for the moment, I'm trying to work on multiple projects so be ready to see some awesome apps!!.

I have some experience on creating Flutter apps, and lately I have been using the Clean Architecture which allows me to create complex apps and maintain them. Flutter is based on Dart programming language so I have and advanced level on Dart aswell, in fact I did a workshop about Dart programming language in a club  named GDSC (Google Developers Student Club) in my University (USTHB) and it was good (I got positive feedback from the students).

You can check my LinkedIn profile [[LinkedIn profile][https://www.linkedin.com/in/massinissa-mouhoub-653530252/]] where I'm actif and I post my learning journey and my projects.

I uploaded some projects that I built, even tho lately I gain a lot of knowledge so I can build much more complex apps than these, It just that I didn't have the time to complete apps that I started because of my PFE (Projet de Fin d'Etude) which is an Android app which is much more complex than the ones I included.
