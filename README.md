I am **Massinissa Mouhoub**, I'm a computer science (_Bioinformatics_ to be more precise) student in USTHB Algiers, Algeria.
I always want to learn more, gain knowledge and to be a better version of myself. I wanna achieve my goals and help others achieve theirs aswell.

I'm interested in AI, I'm currently working on my portfolio and I'm currently expanding my knowledge in the AI field.
